#The difference between the two is that using double quotes makes it easy to include apostrophes
#(whereas these would terminate the string if using single quotes)

#We cannot use single inside single qoutes and double inside double qoutes
#If we want to use single qoutes inside single quotes and in double qoutes case ,we can use like this:
print('hello\'world\' world')
print("hello\"world\" world)
